# JavaScript Concepts

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declaring variables with `var`, `let`, or `const`.
   - Data types include numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and symbols.

2. **Operators:**
   - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   - Comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
   - Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).

3. **Control Flow:**
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
   - Switch statement for multi-way branching.
   - Looping with `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `forEach`, `for-of`, `for-in`.

4. **Difference between `let` and `var`:**
   - `let`: Block-scoped, not hoisted.
   - `var`: Function-scoped, hoisted.

5. **undefined vs. not defined:**
   - `undefined`: Variable is declared but not assigned a value.
   - `not defined`: Variable is not declared.

7. **Functions:**
   - Declaring and calling functions.
   - Function parameters and return values.
   - Function expressions and arrow functions.

8. **Objects:**
   - Creating objects with properties and methods.
   - Accessing and modifying object properties.
   - Object literals and constructor functions.

9. **Arrays:**
   - Creating arrays and accessing elements.
   - Array methods (e.g., `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `indexOf`, `join`, `toString`, `splice`).
   - Iterating through arrays with loops.

10. **String Methods:**
   - Common string manipulation methods - `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `slice`, `split`, `replace`.

11. **Hoisting:**
    - The process of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope.

12. **Truthy and Falsy Values:**
    - Understanding values evaluated as true or false.

13. **Destructuring Array and Object:**
    - Extracting values from arrays and objects in a concise way.

14. **Spread and Rest Operator on '...arr/obj':**
    - Spreading values or gathering them into arrays/objects.

15. **Nullish Coalescing Operator '??':**
    - Provides a default value when dealing with null or undefined.

16. **Optional Chaining '?.':**
    - It resolves The “Non-existing Property” Problem.
    - Safely accessing nested object properties.

17. **Object Literal:**
    - Creating and using object literals.

18. **Template Literal:**
    - Enhanced string literals with backticks.

19. **Ternary Operator:**
    - A concise way to write conditional statements.

20. **Difference between || and ??:**
    - Logical OR (`||`) vs. Nullish Coalescing (`??`) operators.

21. **Higher-Order Function:**
    - Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.

22. **Ajax and Fetch API:**
    - Making asynchronous requests to servers.
    - Using `XMLHttpRequest` or the modern `Fetch` API.

23. **Error Handling:**
    - Handling errors with `try`, `catch`, and `finally`.
    - Throwing and catching custom exceptions.

24. **Currying:**
    - Currying: Transforming a function with multiple parameters into a sequence of functions.
    - Infinite Currying: Continuously currying a function.

25. **Throttling and Debouncing:**
    - Throttling: Ensuring a function is not called more often than a specified time interval.
    - Debouncing: Ensuring that time passes before a function is called.

26. **Window Object:**
    - Represents the browser window and provides properties and methods.

27. **Event:**
    - Bubbling and Capturing: Phases of event propagation.
    - Custom Event: User-defined events.
    - Event Object: Provides information about the event.
    - Contextmenu Event: Triggered on right-click.

28. **Lifecycle DOM Events:**
    - Events during the lifecycle of a web page, e.g., `DOMContentLoaded`, `load`, `unload`.

29. **DOM Manipulation:**
    - Selecting and modifying HTML elements.
    - Creating, deleting, and modifying elements in the Document Object Model (DOM).

30. **Storage:**
    - `localStorage`: Persistent storage with no expiration time.
    - `sessionStorage`: Storage for a session, cleared when the session ends.

31. **Regular functions vs. Arrow functions:**

32. **Asynchronous JavaScript:**
    - Callback functions.
    - Promises for handling asynchronous operations.
    - `async/await` for asynchronous code in a synchronous style.

33. **Modules and Modularization:**
    - Importing and exporting modules using `import` and `export` statements.
    - Organizing code into separate files and modules.

34. **Bind(), Call(), and Apply():**
    - Methods for setting the `this` value and invoking functions.

35. **Anonymous Function:**
    - Functions without an identifier/name.

36. **JSON:**
    - Methods for working with JSON data - `JSON.stringify`, `JSON.parse`.

37. **Date Object:**
    - Working with dates

38. **Cookies:**
    - Storing small pieces of information on the client-side.

39. **Scope:**
    - The context in which variables are declared and can be accessed.

40. **Closures:**
    - Understanding closures and lexical scope.
    - Creating closures for data encapsulation and private variables.
    - Functions that have access to variables from their outer scope.
   
41. **Implicit Type Coercion:**
    - String coercion
    - Boolean Coercion
    - Logical operators
    - Equality Coercion
   
42. **Copy and reference or passed by value and passed by reference:**
43. **Object Prototype:**
