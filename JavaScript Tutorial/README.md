# JavaScript Code Execution Process

JavaScript code execution involves several steps, from lexical analysis to the completion of execution. Below is a step-by-step explanation:

### 1. **Lexical Analysis (Tokenization):**
   - The source code is broken into smaller units called tokens.
   - Tokens include keywords, identifiers, operators, and punctuation.

### 2. **Parsing (Syntax Analysis):**
   - The parser builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the stream of tokens.
   - AST represents the hierarchical structure of the code.

### 3. **Compilation (Bytecode/Intermediate Code Generation):**
   - The AST is transformed into an intermediate representation or bytecode.
   - Modern JavaScript engines may optimize the code during this step.

### 4. **Execution Context Creation:**
   - An execution context is created for each function or block of code.
   - The context includes the Variable Object (VO), Scope Chain, `this` value, and a reference to the outer lexical environment.

### 5. **Variable and Function Hoisting:**
   - Declarations are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes during the creation phase.
   - Variables and functions can be used before they are declared.

### 6. **Scope Chain and Lexical Scoping:**
   - The Scope Chain is established based on lexical scope.
   - Execution contexts have references to their outer lexical environments, forming a chain of scopes.

### 7. **this Binding:**
   - The `this` value is determined based on how a function is called.
   - In a function, `this` refers to the object to which the function belongs.

### 8. **Code Execution:**
   - The code is executed line by line, with each statement being evaluated.
   - Operations such as assignments, calculations, and function calls take place.

### 9. **Asynchronous Operations:**
   - For asynchronous operations, the event loop handles tasks without blocking the main execution thread.

### 10. **Garbage Collection:**
   - The engine performs garbage collection to reclaim memory occupied by unused objects.

### 11. **Completion of Execution:**
   - Once all statements are executed and the event queue is empty, the JavaScript engine completes the code execution.

### 12. **Error Handling:**
   - If an error occurs, the engine throws an exception, halting execution.
   - Errors are logged or handled using mechanisms like `try/catch`.


# Browser Context API in JavaScript

The Browser Context API in JavaScript refers to the environment in which JavaScript code is executed within a web browser. It encompasses various components that contribute to the execution of JavaScript code.

## Execution Context

The Execution Context is a fundamental concept that represents the environment in which JavaScript code runs. Every time a function is invoked, a new execution context is created. It consists of three key components:

- **Variable Object (VO):** Stores variables, function declarations, and formal parameters.
- **Scope Chain:** Determines the accessibility of variables and functions.
- **`this` Value:** Refers to the object to which the current function belongs.

## Lexical Environment

The Lexical Environment involves the association between identifiers (variables and functions) and their lexical scope. Lexical scope is determined by the physical placement of the code in the source code.

## Stack and Heap Memory

- **Stack Memory:** Used for storing function call information, local variables, and control flow. It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
  
- **Heap Memory:** Used for dynamic memory allocation, especially for objects created during runtime. Unlike the stack, heap memory does not have a specific order for allocating and deallocating memory.

## Copy and Reference

- **Copy:** When primitive data types (e.g., numbers or strings) are assigned to variables, the actual value is copied to the new variable. Changes in one variable do not affect the other.

  ```javascript
  let a = 10;
  let b = a; // Copy
  b = 20;   // Changes in 'b' do not affect 'a'
